# Line Follower Robot

The line follower robot is a mobile machine that can detect and follow the line drawn on the floor. Generally, the path is predefined and can be either visible like a black line on a white surface with a high contrasted color or it can be invisible like a magnetic field.

# Components
- Arduino UNO
- IR sensor x 2
- DC Gear Motor x 4
- L298N Motor driver
- Battery 7.4 x 2
- Battery Holder
- Motor wheel x 4
- Wire m-f x 20
- PVC board 20 x 12 cm

## Software
-  Arduino IDE


## Programming Language
-  Arduino Programming Language
## Goals

The project aims to create a line follower robot able to follow a path and reach its destination. Sensing a line and maneuvering the robot to stay on course while constantly correcting wrong moves using feedback from sensors forms a simple yet effective system. 
## Features

- Follow line
- Taking various degrees of turns
